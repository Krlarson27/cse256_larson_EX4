# cse256_larson_EX4

#the program for this assignment is to use the import random module to enable the ability to creat a guessing 
#based off the letters that are inputted. if the incorrect letters are inputted enough the game will end
#once the progams were developed, we went into command prompt and with our git hub repository link and cloned
#the repository locally. once programs were place within folder that was cloned to our computer, we utilize
#git add guess_the_word.py test_guess_the_word.py to add the files to the directory. then using git commit to save changes and 
#git push origin main to update git hub. once updated, we refresh github repository and see the programs are applied. In command
#prompt we run pytest test_guess_the_word.py to run the code "guess_the_word.py" to test if the games fucntion are properly running
